# The Not-for-AirPods USB-C Protection Cases

Each folder contains the 3D files if you want to print your own version of the cases or need them for another reason.

The PCB schematics are always the same, so I won't include them here. You can find them in the *usb-c_internal_kits* folder located in the root of this repository. I don't think I will include any Gerber files or KiCad project for this, simply because it takes time to maintain and I found that nobody uses them since some chips are almost impossible to source without the right contact (that I sadly can't share for obvious reasons).

To secure the plastic parts together you will also need: 

- 2x M1.4 nuts. 
- 2x M1.4x5 screws (M1.4x4 for max_A2096). I use black powder coated DIN 912 screws.
