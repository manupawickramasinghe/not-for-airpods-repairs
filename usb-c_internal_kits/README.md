# The Not-for-AirPods USB-C Mod

Folder *flosspods_1_2_flex* contains the KiCad project if you want to order the PCB yourself. It works on Gen. 1 and Gen. 2 (both wired-only and wireless versions!). You need to generate the Gerber files yourself. There is an extra file called *flosspods_1_2_flex-stiffener.jpg*. It shows where I've placed the stiffener for the connector. It's nice to have but not a requirement. You send that file to the board house along with your Gerber files. Here it was sent to PCBWay.

File *bracket_1_2.dxf* is the metallic bracket I've ordered to be laser cut. It was cut in 0.5mm stainless steel.

File *sourcing.png* is a hint to find the source for the chips. I don't want to post those links. If you're smart enough to replicate this project, you're smart enough to find what you're looking for with this ;) If you can't find those chips, just use the same outline but adapt the circuit to the chips you found. Then you can make a pull request. Seems like a lot of effort, but if you want to learn there is no better way.

Folder *flosspods_pro_flex* contains the KiCad project if you want to order the PCB yourself. It works on model Pro Gen. 1 (M4g$af3 and non-M4g$af3). You need to generate the Gerber files yourself. There is an extra file called *flosspods_pro_flex-stiffener.jpg*. It shows where I've placed the stiffener for the connector. It's nice to have but not a requirement. You send that file to the board house along with your Gerber files. Here it was sent to PCBWay.

File *bracket_pro.dxf* is the metallic bracket I've ordered to be laser cut. It was cut in 0.5mm stainless steel.

## Improvements for the future:

- Move to a waterproof connector. This is very low priority as the 3D printed case from the liberation kit also needs to be waterproof... (done for pro!)
- Improve for mid-scale manufacturing run? (done for pro!)
